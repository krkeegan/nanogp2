### :arrow_forward: Upgrading von NANOGP to NANOGP2
The API used by nanogp is depreciated by Google and will be turned off on **march 2019**.
A new API is available but the usage is not compatible with the depreciated one.

##### Migration - step by step
1. Install nanogp2 in a new folder (do not install over nanogp)
2. Configure nanogp2
3. update nanogallery2 settings in your HTML pages:  
   - point google2URL to the new nanogp2 URL, e.g.: `'google2URL': 'https://YOUR_WEB_SERVER/nanogp/nanogp2.php'`
   - album's IDs have changed, id used, update the value of the `album ` parameter
